# SD Webui Boomer
This is an Extension for the [Automatic1111 Webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui), which reverts some UI changes that came with `Webui v1.6.0`.

## "Features"
1. Move `Apply Style` button back under **Generate**
2. Change the icons of the `Send to img2img` and such buttons back to texts
3. Restore the old "`thumbs`" look of **Extra Networks**
    - You can delete the `style.css` file inside this Extension folder if you don't want this
